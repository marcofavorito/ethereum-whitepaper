## A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform {#a-next-generation-smart-contract-and-decentralized-application-platform}

_This introductory paper was originally published in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, before the project's launch in 2015. It's worth noting that Ethereum, like many community-driven, open-source software projects, has evolved since its initial inception._

_While several years old, we maintain this paper because it continues to serve as a useful reference and an accurate representation of Ethereum and its vision. To learn about the latest developments of Ethereum, and how changes to the protocol are made, we recommend this guide._

Satoshi Nakamoto's development of Bitcoin in 2009 has often been hailed
as a radical development in money and currency, being the first example
of a digital asset which simultaneously has no backing or [intrinsic value](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/8640/an-exploration-of-intrinsic-value-what-it-is-why-bitcoin-doesnt-have-it-and-why-bitcoin-does-have-it/)
and no centralized issuer or controller. However, another - arguably
more important - part of the Bitcoin experiment is the underlying
blockchain technology as a tool of distributed consensus, and attention
is rapidly starting to shift to this other aspect of Bitcoin. Commonly
cited alternative applications of blockchain technology include using
on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and
financial instruments ([colored coins](https://docs.google.com/a/buterin.com/document/d/1AnkP_cVZTCMLIzw4DvsW6M8Q2JC0lIzrTLuoWu2z1BE/edit)),
the ownership of an underlying physical device ([smart property](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Smart_Property)), non-fungible
assets such as domain names ([Namecoin](http://namecoin.org)), as well
as more complex applications involving having digital assets being
directly controlled by a piece of code implementing arbitrary rules
([smart contracts](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/idea.html))
or even blockchain-based [decentralized autonomous organizations](http://bitcoinmagazine.com/7050/bootstrapping-a-decentralized-autonomous-corporation-part-i/)
(DAOs). What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in
fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to
create "contracts" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition
functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above,
as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing
up the logic in a few lines of code.
